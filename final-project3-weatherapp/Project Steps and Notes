Notes for this project

• To create a user interface using Jetpack standards
• To utilize a Web Service as the source of data, and use API calls
• To develop a simple, but useful, Weather app

Basic Process Steps

- call the OpenWeatherMap.org API and display the result to my phone
- set up the project and display
- set up a splash screen
- make the API call
- format the JSON response from the API for our app

Set up the weather API

- sign up for account on openweathermap.org
- generate API key --> d782c3641dcc9cbcb8528dfb0245b3e4
- api key needed for project: 
- set up imperial units
- test the call in Postman
-

Set up the project and display

- open android studio and create a new project - empty activity

- set up permission in the android manifest file: internet, fine location, coarse location

- determine what kind of Jetpack component to include in the code...I went with ViewModel

- migrate the Kotlin code from 1.5 to 1.8

- not sure why the gradle build took a bit to run
