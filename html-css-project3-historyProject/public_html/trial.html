    <h2>Galileos' Accusation of Heresy</h2>
    
    <p id="index-body">In 1633, there was an inquisition supported by Pope Urban VIII for Galileo to come to trial at the Holy Office. He was accused of being a heretic because his scientific findings went against the doctrine of The Church. Further, he refused to accept the Church's statement of the Earth being the center of the universe. Galileo risked his life and liberty to advocate for knowledge and science in the holy courts.</p>
    
    <p id="index-body">Galileo had been warned by The Church for almost 20 years prior to the trial for his astronomy work published in books. In court, Galileo produced a letter by an official who wrote that the findings would be kept in limbo and would not "be used" to encourage or discourage the Church's way of thinking.</p>
    
    <p id="index-body">The verdict came and Galileo was convicted. He was instructed to recant most of his life's work. Wow. He was immediately ordered to denounce the "doctrine" he was "preaching". In order to lighten his sentence, Galileo claimed that he dreamed that "God was not real" to make his research sound absurd to the court.</p>
    
    <p id="index-body">If Galileo ever came out and said he believed in heliocentrism, then he would be sentenced to death. Galileo lived out the rest of his life in custody for a while. In late 1633, he received permission to retire to a farmhouse. He passed in 1642.</p>
