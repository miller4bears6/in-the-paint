    <h2>Significance in Science</h2>
    
    <p id="index-body">Galileo is well known for using a telescope to make incredible discoveries and proving scientific facts about our solar system. He observed various phases of the moons of Jupiter which enhanced time keeping methods back then.</p>
    
    <p id="index-body">Galileo partnered with Johannes Kepler to establish facts in astronomy. Sir Isaac Newton later proved those theories correct later on. Galileo helped to confirm the amazing theory, that all of our planets including Earth, revolve around the sun with his research. This sparked the scientific revolution. The theory first broke ground by Nicolaus Copernicus, several years earlier.</p>

This rocked over 2000 years of assumptions that the Earth is the center of our universe.</p>
